## Virtual On-Site Shopping

Virtual On-Site Shopping is a student project with the aim to realize a partly virtual supermarket. <br />
This repository contains the Android part of Virtual On-Site Shopping. This app shows the start page and proceeds to a categories page if the device is touched by a smart card.  <br />

By a click on the category "Dairy Products" the html/js part of the app is opened. In this prototype the html/js part has to be stored on the device's storage. 

## Download and more Information

Further development requires Android Studio, we recommend to use at least version 2.2.2
